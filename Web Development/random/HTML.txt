DNS(domain name system)
Keeps record of every domain name and its IPaddress
Once we recieve the IPaddress then we send an html request to the website
https://courses.techpixies.com/my-page
https--Protocol
courses--Sub domain
techpixies.com--Domain 
my-page--slug
Domain tells the name of the website that you are visiting
.com shows what entity or organisation owns that site 
.com is used for commercial purposes
.edu is used for educational purposes
slug helps to understand what particular part of the web page we are on
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Website is a collection of a webpages
They need to be saved from web servers and after sending the request to the web server we can access them
Dynamic Wesite is a website that will change and interact with you in realtime and take you from page to another
Static Website is one that has web pages stored on the server in the format that is sent to a client web browser
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DNS is similar to phonebook it maintains and maps the name of the website and proccess all requests from the user ends
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Web Development has 2 parts to it
i) Front end part--what the user sees when he opens a website
ii) Back end part--the work being done to present the front end to the user
all information is stored in the back end
Javascript is required to insert dynamic elements to the website
HTML-Hyper Text Markup Language
mark language-defines a set of rules for encoding documnets in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable
Difference between markup language and proggraming language 
we dont need compiler or inetrpreter or msrkup language
programming language is giving a set of instructions to the computer
markup language is helping the computer to present some information
HTML is not a case sensitive language
We use html by using tags
<!DOCTYPEHTML>what type of file is being used and how it should be rendered on the screen
<HTML> is the tag must be present at the begening and end 
<Head> is the tag that gives the name of the heading of the page
<Title> is the tag that gives the name of the page title
any tag with a foward slash has a closing tag
most of the tags in HTML has an attribute and provides additional information about it
<h1> is the biggest font size 
<h6> is the smallest font size
they have closing tags
*empty tags dont need a closing tag
<p></p> is a paragraph tag
<br> breaks line
<hr> horizontal line
<a href = "link"> content</a> this will link to another page 
<div> this for dividing the webpages to multiple portions
